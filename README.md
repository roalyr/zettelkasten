 <details markdown='1'><summary>Useful software (Android)</summary>

`Markor`, a free and versatile markdown editor: [GitHub](https://github.com/gsantner/markor), [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.gsantner.markor), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.gsantner.markor)
I prefer to use _DIN condensed regular_ font with it.
 
`Termux`, a unix-like environment for Android: [Official site](https://termux.com/)  
This software provides for `git` and `python3` binaries which I may suggest (see [common_actions.py](common_actions.py) ) to back up your ZK to the remote git storage.

This is a template that represents my vision of a mobile-phone friendly markdown-based ZK. It is imperfect, but it may be useful. I take liberty in extending the algorithm with my suggestions, which are entirely optional.
 
The main key points: 
1. Stick to the main principles of ZK notes: 
- One idea per note.
- Use your own words.
- Keep it short and simple.
- Links are important.  

2. It is preferable if liks are bi-directional. This way one could navigate the database in any direction via the links between files seamlessly.  

3. I may suggest different types of zettels: _statement_ - which is a classical entry, an atomic idea, a building block of ZK;  
_question_ - a note that records a question akin to "what's the matter?" and provides answer variants in links to other zettels;  
_free form_ - it may be a lengthy record of your thoughts when you have a spark of inspiration, or when you need to convey something that appeals to emotions to your future self, or it can be anything else worthy of being recorded, depending on your needs. It may be useful to convey emotions and moods.

5. Additional information, such as references, quotes, etc. can go under "More" spoiler (see template).

The principle of contributing to ZK based on this template:  
1. Save the idea to [notepad](notepad.md), copy respective source link if required.
2. Review, revise, prepare the draft of a zettel from the note.  
3. Create a file with `.md` extension for zettel in the `ZETTELS` folder.  
4. Link zettel with other zettels.  
5. Link other zettels to the zettel (if required).  
6. Optional: Insert supplementary information under spoiler.

If adding a new entry-point (topic) zettel:  
1. Link zettel in one of the catalogue lists in `INDEX` folder.  
2. If necessary - create a new catalogue and link it to the [main index](main_index.md)
